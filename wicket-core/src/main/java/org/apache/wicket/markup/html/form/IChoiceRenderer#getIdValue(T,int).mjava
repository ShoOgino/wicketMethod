	/**
	 * This method is called to get the id value of an object (used as the value attribute of a

	 * stable you could just return a toString of the index.
	 * <p>
	 * Note that the given index can be {@code -1} if the object in question is not contained in the
	 * available choices.
	 *
	 * @param object
	 *            The object for which the id should be generated
	 * @param index
	 *            The index of the object in the choices list.
	 * @return String
