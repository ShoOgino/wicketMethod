	/**
	 * When the page renders to buffer and it is still stateless after rendering, this flag
	 * determines whether the redirect will take place or not.
	 * <p>
	 * By default we will redirect. This is so we do not end up having the browser be on a listener
	 * URL. A simple scenario is calling {@code setResponsePage(new StatelessPage())} inside form's
	 * {@code onSubmit()} or link's {@code onClick()} callbacks, or any other listener interface
	 * callback. What will happen is that the browser will be on URL like
	 * {@code ./wicket/page?0-2.IFormSubmitListener-form}, and we will not redirect - leaving the
	 * browser on such URL. This is a worse alternative then saving one redirect because it may
	 * cause problems if user presses the refresh button in the browser.
