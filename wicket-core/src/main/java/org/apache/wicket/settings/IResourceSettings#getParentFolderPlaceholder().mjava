	 * Placeholder string for '..' within resource urls (which will be crippled by the browser and
	 * not work anymore). Note that by default the placeholder string is <code>null</code> and thus
	 * will not allow to access parent folders. That is by purpose and for security reasons (see
	 * Wicket-1992). In case you really need it, a good value for placeholder would e.g. be "$up$".
	 * Resources additionally are protected by a
	 * {@link org.apache.wicket.markup.html.IPackageResourceGuard IPackageResourceGuard}
	 * implementation such as {@link org.apache.wicket.markup.html.PackageResourceGuard} which you
	 * may use or extend based on your needs.
