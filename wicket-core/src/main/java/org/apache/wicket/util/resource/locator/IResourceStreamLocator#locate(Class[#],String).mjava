	/**
	 * Locate a resource, given a path and class. Typically this method is either called by external
	 * clients if they are not interested in a lookup that takes the style and locale into account,
	 * or it is called by the implementation of
	 * {@link #locate(Class, String, String, Locale, String)} where the latter just takes care of
	 * trying out the different combinations for the provided style and locale and uses this method
	 * to actually load the resource stream.
	 * 
	 * @param clazz
	 *            The class loader for delegating the loading of the resource
	 * @param path
	 *            The path of the resource
	 * 
	 * @return The resource or null
