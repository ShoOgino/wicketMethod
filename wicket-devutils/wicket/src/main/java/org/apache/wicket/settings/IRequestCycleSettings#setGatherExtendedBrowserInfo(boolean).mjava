	/**
	 * Sets whether Wicket should try to get extensive client info by redirecting to
	 * {@link BrowserInfoPage a page that polls for client capabilities}. This method is used by
	 * the default implementation of {@link WebRequestCycle#newClientInfo()}, so if that method is
	 * overridden, there is no guarantee this method will be taken into account.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * <strong>WARNING: </strong> though this facility should work transparently in most cases, it
	 * is recommended that you trigger the roundtrip to get the browser info somewhere where it
	 * hurts the least. The roundtrip will be triggered the first time you call
	 * {@link Session#getClientInfo()} for a session, and after the roundtrip a new request with the
	 * same info (url, post parameters) is handled. So rather than calling this in the middle of an
	 * implementation of a form submit method, which would result in the code of that method before
	 * the call to {@link Session#getClientInfo()} to be executed twice, you best call
	 * {@link Session#getClientInfo()} e.g. in a page constructor or somewhere else where you didn't
	 * do a lot of processing first.
	 * </p>
