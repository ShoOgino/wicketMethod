	/**
	 * Returns the prefix used when building validator keys. This allows a form to use a separate
	 * "set" of keys. For example if prefix "short" is returned, validator key short.Required will
	 * be tried instead of Required key.
	 * <p>
	 * This can be useful when different designs are used for a form. In a form where error messages
	 * are displayed next to their respective form components as opposed to at the top of the form,
	 * the ${label} attribute is of little use and only causes redundant information to appear in
	 * the message. Forms like these can return the "short" (or any other string) validator prefix
	 * and declare key: short.Required=required to override the longer message which is usually
	 * declared like this: Required=${label} is a required field
	 * <p>
	 * Returned prefix will be used for all form components. The prefix can also be overridden on
	 * form component level by overriding {@link FormComponent#getValidatorKeyPrefix()}
	 * 
	 * @return prefix prepended to validator keys
