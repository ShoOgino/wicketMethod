	 * When applyTimeZoneDifference is true, the current time is applied on the parsed date, and the
	 * date will be corrected for the time zone difference between the server and the client. For
	 * instance, if I'm in Seattle and the server I'm working on is in Amsterdam, the server is 9
	 * hours ahead. So, if I'm inputting say 12/24 at a couple of hours before midnight, at the
	 * server it is already 12/25. If this boolean is true, it will be transformed to 12/25, while
	 * the client sees 12/24.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * @param datePattern
	 *            The pattern to use. Must be not null. See {@link SimpleDateFormat} for available
	 *            patterns.
	 * @param applyTimeZoneDifference
	 *            whether to apply the difference in time zones between client and server
	 * @throws IllegalArgumentException
	 *             in case the date pattern is null
