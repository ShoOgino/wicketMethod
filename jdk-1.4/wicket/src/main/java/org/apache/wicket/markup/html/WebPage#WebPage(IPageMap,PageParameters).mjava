	/**
	 * Constructor which receives wrapped query string parameters for a request. Having this
	 * constructor public means that your page is 'bookmarkable' and hence can be called/ created
	 * from anywhere. For bookmarkable pages (as opposed to when you construct page instances
	 * yourself, this constructor will be used in preference to a no-arg constructor, if both exist.
	 * Note that nothing is done with the page parameters argument. This constructor is provided so
	 * that tools such as IDEs will include it their list of suggested constructors for derived
	 * classes.
	 *
	 * Please call this constructor (or the one without the pagemap) if you want to remember the
	 * pageparameters {@link #getPageParameters()}. So that they are reused for stateless links.
	 *
	 * @param pageMap
	 *            The pagemap where the webpage needs to be constructed in.
	 * @param parameters
	 *            Wrapped query string parameters.
