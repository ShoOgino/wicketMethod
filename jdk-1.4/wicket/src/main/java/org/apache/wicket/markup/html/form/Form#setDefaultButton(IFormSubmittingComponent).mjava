	 * Sets the default IFormSubmittingComponent. If set (not null), a hidden submit component will
	 * be rendered right after the form tag, so that when users press enter in a textfield, this
	 * submit component's action will be selected. If no default component is set (so unset by
	 * calling this method with null), nothing additional is rendered.
	 * <p>
	 * WARNING: note that this is a best effort only. Unfortunately having a 'default' button in a
	 * form is ill defined in the standards, and of course IE has it's own way of doing things.
	 * </p>
	 * There can be only one default button per form hierarchy. So if you set default button on a
	 * nested form, it will actually delegate the call to root form. </b>

	 * @param submittingComponent
	 *            The component to set as the default submitting component, or null when you want to
	 *            'unset' any previously set default component
