	 * CLIENTS SHOULD NEVER CALL THIS METHOD FOR DAY TO DAY USE!
	 * <p>
	 * A subclass may override this method to implement redirection. Subclasses which have no need
	 * to do redirection may choose not to override this default implementation, which does nothing.
	 * For example, if a subclass wishes to write output to a file or is part of a testing harness,
	 * there may be no meaning to redirection.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Framework users who want to redirect should use a construction like <code>
	 * RequestCycle.get().setRequestTarget(new RedirectRequestTarget(...));
	 * </code>
	 * or <code>
	 * setResponsePage(new RedirectPage(...));
	 * </code>
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * @param url
	 *            The URL to redirect to
