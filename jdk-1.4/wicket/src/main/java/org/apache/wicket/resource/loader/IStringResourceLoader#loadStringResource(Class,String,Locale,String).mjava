	 * Get the string resource for the given combination of component class, resource key, locale
	 * and style. The component class provided is used to allow implementation of component specific
	 * resource loading (e.g. per page or per reusable component). The key should be a String
	 * containing a lookup key into a resource bundle. The locale should contain the locale of the
	 * current operation so that the appropriate set of resources can be selected. The style allows
	 * the set of resources to select to be varied by skin/brand.

	 * @param clazz
	 *            The class to get the string resource for
