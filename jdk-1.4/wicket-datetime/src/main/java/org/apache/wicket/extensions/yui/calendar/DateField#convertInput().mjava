	 * input. So we're just passing that on.

	 * Note that overriding this method is a better option than overriding
	 * {@link #updateModel()} like the first versions of this class did. The
	 * reason for that is that this method can be used by form validators
	 * without having to depend on the actual model being updated, and this
	 * method is called by the default implementation of {@link #updateModel()}
	 * anyway (so we don't have to override that anymore).
	 * </p>
