	/**
	 * Toggles automatic conversation management feature.
	 * 
	 * Automatic conversation management controls the lifecycle of the conversation based on
	 * presense of components implementing the {@link ConversationalComponent} interface. If such
	 * components are found in the page a conversation is makred persistent, and if they are not the
	 * conversation is marked transient. This greatly simplifies the management of conversation
	 * lifecycle.
	 * 
	 * Sometimes it is necessary to manually control the application. For these cases, once a
	 * conversation is started {@link AutoConversation} bean can be used to mark the conversation as
	 * manually-managed.
	 * 
	 * @param enabled
	 * 
	 * @return {@code this} for easy chaining
