	/**
	 * Returns the score representing how compatible this request mapper is to processing the given
	 * request. When a request comes in all mappers are scored and are tried in order from highest
	 * score to lowest.
	 * <p>
	 * A good criteria for calculating the score is the number of matched url segments. For example
	 * when there are two encoders for mounted page, one mapped to <code>/foo</code> another to
	 * <code>/foo/bar</code> and the incoming request URL is </code>/foo/bar/baz</code>, the encoder
	 * mapped to <code>/foo/bar</code> will handle the request first as it has matching segments
	 * count of 2 while the first one has only matching segments count of 1.
	 * <p>
	 * Note that the method can return value greater then zero even if the encoder can not decode
	 * the request.
	 * 
	 * @param request
	 * @return count of matching segments
