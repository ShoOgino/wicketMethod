	/**
	 * Gets the class of the destination page, which serves as a form of
	 * identity that can be used at rendering time to determine if a link is on
	 * the same Page that it links to (except when pages are parameterized. in
	 * that case, see Link.linksTo for details).
	 * <p>
	 * This page identity class is important because links which are on the same
	 * page that they link to often need to be displayed in a different way to
	 * indicate that they are 'disabled' and don't go anywhere. Links can be
	 * manually disabled by calling Link.setDisabled(). Links which have
	 * setAutoEnable(true) will automatically enable or disable themselves
	 * depending on whether or not Link.linksTo() returns true.  The default 
     * implementation of PageLink.linksTo() therefore looks like this:
     * <pre>
     *     private final IPageLink pageLink;
     *
     *     public boolean linksTo(final Page page)
     *     {
     *         return page.getClass() == pageLink.getDestinationIdentity();
     *     }
     * </pre>
	 * 
	 * @return The class of page linked to, as a form of identity
     * @see Link#linksTo(Page)
	 */
	public Class getDestinationIdentity();
