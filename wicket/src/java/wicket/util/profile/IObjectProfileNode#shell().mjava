     * Returns the shell pseudo-node for this node. This represents all instance data

     * primitive data fields, object references representing non-primitive fields, and
     * (for arrays) the array length field and storage required for the array slots.
     * <P>
     * Another way to describe this is that node.shell().size() is the minimum size an
     * instance of node.object().getClass() can be (when all non-primitive instance fields
     * are set to 'null').
     * <P>
     * The returned reference is also guaranteed to be present somewhere in the array
     * returned by {@link #children()}. This data is kept in a separate node instance to
     * simplify tree visiting and node filtering.
