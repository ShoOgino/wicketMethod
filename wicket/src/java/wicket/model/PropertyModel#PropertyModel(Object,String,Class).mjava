	 * @param propertyType
	 *            the type to be used for conversion instead of the type that is
	 *            figured out by Ognl. This can be especially usefull for when
	 *            you have a generic property (like Serializable myProp) that
	 *            you want to be converted to a narrower type (e.g. an Integer).
	 *            Ognl sees an incomming string being compatible with the target
	 *            property, and will then bypass the converter. Hence, to force
	 *            myProp being converted to and from and integer, propertyType
	 *            should be set to Integer.
