	/**
	 * Detaches the component.
	 * <p>
	 * NOTE: this method is not inherited from {@link IDetachable} on purpose. in Wicket the
	 * assumption for a long time has been that {@link Component}s do not implement
	 * {@link IDetachable}; doing so may lead to some very nasty side-effects. Consider {@code
	 * AbstractPropertyModel#detach()} which looks like this:
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * public void detach()
	 * {
	 * 	// Detach nested object if it's a detachable
	 * 	if (target instanceof IDetachable)
	 * 	{
	 * 		((IDetachable)target).detach();
	 * 	}
	 * }
	 * </pre>
	 * 
	 * If the model was constructed thusly, which is quite common: {@code new PropertyModel(this,
	 * "person")} and {@link Component} implemented {@link IDetachable} then calling @{code
	 * model.detach()} will cause an infinite loop with the model trying to detach the component and
	 * the component trying to detach the model.
	 * 
	 * </p>
