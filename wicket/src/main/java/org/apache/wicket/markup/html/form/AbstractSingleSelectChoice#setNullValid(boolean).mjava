	 * /** Determines whether or not the null value should be included in the list of choices when
	 * the field's model value is nonnull, and whether or not the null_valid string property (e.g.
	 * "Choose One") should be displayed until a nonnull value is selected.
	 * 
	 * If set to false, then "Choose One" will be displayed when the value is null. After a value is
	 * selected, and that change is propagated to the underlying model, the user will no longer see
	 * the "Choose One" option, and there will be no way to reselect null as the value.
	 * 
	 * If set to true, the null string property (the empty string, by default) will always be
	 * displayed as an option, whether or not a nonnull value has ever been selected.
	 * 
	 * Note that this setting has no effect on validation; in order to guarantee that a value will
	 * be specified on form validation, {@link #setRequired(boolean)}. This is because even if
	 * setNullValid() is called with false, the user can fail to provide a value simply by never
	 * activating (i.e. clicking on) the component.

	 * @param nullValid
	 *            whether null is a valid value
